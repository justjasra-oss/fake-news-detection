# Fake News Detection Project

## **Project Overview**

This project detects whether a news article is **fake** or **real** using a machine learning model. Users can input news text, and the model predicts its authenticity.

## **Folder Structure**

```
fake-news-detection/
│
├── dataset/
│   └── fake_or_real_news.csv   # Dataset of fake & real news
│
├── model/
│   └── train_model.py          # Code to train ML model
│   └── model.pkl               # Trained model file
│   └── vectorizer.pkl          # TF-IDF vectorizer
│
├── app.py                      # Streamlit app to test news
└── requirements.txt            # Python dependencies
```
## Dataset

The dataset `fake_or_real_news.csv` is too large to upload directly to GitHub.  
You can download it from Google Drive: [Download Dataset]
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13nB1QBeCHXL-ZhythYTx0MxfTT_zE0GU?usp=share_link

After downloading, place the file inside the `dataset/` folder before running the code.


## **How to Run**

1. Create a conda environment (optional):

```bash
conda create -n fake_news python=3.10
conda activate fake_news
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Train the model (if model.pkl is not present):

```bash
python model/train_model.py
```

4. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

5. Open the URL shown in the terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`) and enter news text to test.
